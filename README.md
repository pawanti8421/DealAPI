Overview:
The Temperature Converter project is a desktop application developed using Java Swing. It allows users to convert temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The application features a straightforward and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that ensures ease of use for anyone needing quick temperature conversions.

Features:
-Simple and Intuitive Interface**: The application has a clean and simple interface where users can easily input temperature values and view conversion results.
-Real-Time Conversion**: Displays converted temperature values instantly as the user inputs a value and clicks the convert button.

GUI Components:
- Input Field: A JTextField where the user inputs the temperature value in Celsius or Fahrenheit or Kelvin. According to input it display the converted temperatures.
- Convert Button: A JButton that, when clicked, performs the temperature conversion.
- Layout: Components are arranged in a grid layout for a clean and organized appearance.


Example Usage
1. The user opens the application.
2. The user enters a temperature value in the Celsius input field (e.g., `0`).
3. The user clicks the "Convert" button.
4. The application displays the converted temperatures in Fahrenheit (`32`) and Kelvin (`273.15`) immediately.


Technologies Used
- Java SE: The programming language used to develop the application.
- Java Swing: The GUI toolkit for building the user interface.
